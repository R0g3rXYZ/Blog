I haven't posted very much since I have been so busy with work and birthday celebrations, but hopefully Ill get some posts made in the next few days. I got some new tools for my birthday so there might be some woodworking and mechanic posts soon too.

I also am working on moving the posts over to a website that supports dynamic stuff like adding likes and comments to posts, so hopefully I can gauge what im doing right and wrong on this blog.

For now, here are some photos from the drive back to my apartment after my bday.
