Lots of skating since I last posted.

Most of my skating has just been practicing my riding on campus, theres a nice spot in the courtyard of the geology building that is pretty shaded.

I finally finished building my board (ill post some pictures of it later) but the deck is warped so Im going to have to get a new one when I have more money. Even though its warped, its still fun to ride so I've been relearning the basics a little bit as I get used to it.
