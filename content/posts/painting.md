Yesterday I was inspired to paint, I wanted to do something small so I can finish it the same day that I had started. I was also a bit hungry for a fried egg, I love how red-orange the yolks are (they are more orange with my camera) and I have the tiniest little pan meant for this moment.

I took a picture with my camera then painted for the rest of the day
