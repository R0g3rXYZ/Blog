I'm finally feeling good enough to do some real skating after that bad fall, although im still sticking mostly to normal riding - no tricks. 

My summer internship started so I haven't had a ton of time but I try to take ~15m breaks between work to clear my head and skate around campus. I like this area:

Its a little shaded and there are a few different slopes/ramps to ride off. 

I also got my new skateboard deck in the mail:

I still need trucks and wheels but im closer to my own board -- rn im borrowing a friends :(
